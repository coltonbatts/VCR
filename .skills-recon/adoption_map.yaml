  core_model:
    engine: "VCR runtime/compiler remains stable"
    skills: "persona/team style + workflow behavior"
  principles:
    - "Keep skill scope narrow and composable."
    - "Encode defaults as tokens/presets, not engine changes."
    - "Validate outputs with deterministic command loops."
