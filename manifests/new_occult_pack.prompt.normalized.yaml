  ROLE
  You are the VCR render engine. Execute deterministically from explicit parameters and fail fast on invalid or missing critical inputs.

  TASK
  Render with these explicit parameters:
  - Resolution: 1080x1920
  - Render FPS: 60
  - Output FPS: 60
  - Duration: 90.000s
  - Frames: 5400
  - Output Type: video
  - Output Path: renders/relic_hand_orb.mov
  - Container: mov
  - Codec: prores_4444
  - Alpha: true
  - Determinism Seed: 0
  - No blocking validation errors were found in timing fields.

  INSTRUCTIONS
  - Determinism is required. Use the fixed seed and avoid time-varying randomness.
  - If exactly one of duration or frame count is provided, derive the other using fps and integer rounding for frames.
  - If render fps differs from output fps, apply frame sampling with interpolation disabled unless explicitly overridden.
  - Validate asset paths, fonts, and output compatibility before rendering.
  - Do not synthesize unsupported features; surface them as validation issues.

  CONTEXT
  - Source mode: natural_language
  - Original input snapshot: Create three NEW high-fidelity 3D assets we have not done before: 1) relic_hand_orb 2) oracle_globe 3) sigil_compass  Style direction: - occult + 90s dreamcore + premium cinematic - vertical mobile composition (1080x1920) - transparent background - deterministic smooth motion  Shared technical requirements for all three assets: - 10 seconds duration - 60 fps - ProRes 4444 MOV with alpha - seed 0 - output paths:   - renders/relic_hand_orb.mov   - renders/oracle_globe.mov   - renders/sigil_compass.mov  Creative requirements: - Relic hand orb: floating stylized 3D hand with occult palm sigil and a hovering orb. - Oracle globe: mystical globe with internal lines/runes and controlled emissive pulse. - Sigil compass: 3D compass-rose/sigil hybrid with clean rotational motion and occult detailing.
  - Normalization produced 1 unresolved issue(s).

  OUTPUT FORMAT
  - Primary artifact path: renders/relic_hand_orb.mov
  - Emit run metadata with resolution, fps, duration_seconds, frames, codec, alpha, seed, and frame conversion policy.

      Create three NEW high-fidelity 3D assets we have not done before:
      1) relic_hand_orb
      2) oracle_globe
      3) sigil_compass

      Style direction:
      - occult + 90s dreamcore + premium cinematic
      - vertical mobile composition (1080x1920)
      - transparent background
      - deterministic smooth motion

      Shared technical requirements for all three assets:
      - 10 seconds duration
      - 60 fps
      - ProRes 4444 MOV with alpha
      - seed 0
      - output paths:
        - renders/relic_hand_orb.mov
        - renders/oracle_globe.mov
        - renders/sigil_compass.mov

      Creative requirements:
      - Relic hand orb: floating stylized 3D hand with occult palm sigil and a hovering orb.
      - Oracle globe: mystical globe with internal lines/runes and controlled emissive pulse.
      - Sigil compass: 3D compass-rose/sigil hybrid with clean rotational motion and occult detailing.

unknowns_and_fixes:
- issue: 'Ambiguous style terms without deterministic parameter mapping: cinematic, dreamcore.'
  why_it_matters: Casual style words are subjective and can produce inconsistent outputs.
  proposed_fix: |-
    Add explicit style directives in YAML, for example:
    scene:
      style_directives:
        bloom: 0.2
        chromatic_aberration_px: 1.5
        grain_strength: 0.1
assumptions_applied:
- Defaulted output fps to render fps because `output.fps` was missing.
- Computed frames as round(duration_seconds*fps) (90.000*60).
acceptance_checks:
- Spec serializes to valid YAML with expected top-level keys.
- assert render.resolution.width == 1080 && render.resolution.height == 1920
- assert render.fps == 60
- assert output.fps == 60
- assert determinism.seed == 0
- assert output.path == "renders/relic_hand_orb.mov" && output.codec == "prores_4444"
- assert frames == round(duration_seconds * fps) (5400 == round(90.000 * 60))
- assert all referenced asset and font paths exist before render execution.
