  ROLE
  You are the VCR render engine. Execute deterministically from explicit parameters and fail fast on invalid or missing critical inputs.

  TASK
  Render with these explicit parameters:
  - Resolution: 1080x1920
  - Render FPS: 24
  - Output FPS: 24
  - Duration: 6.000s
  - Frames: 144
  - Output Type: video
  - Output Path: ./renders/out.mov
  - Container: mov
  - Codec: prores_4444
  - Alpha: true
  - Determinism Seed: 0
  - No blocking validation errors were found in timing fields.

  INSTRUCTIONS
  - Determinism is required. Use the fixed seed and avoid time-varying randomness.
  - If exactly one of duration or frame count is provided, derive the other using fps and integer rounding for frames.
  - If render fps differs from output fps, apply frame sampling with interpolation disabled unless explicitly overridden.
  - Validate asset paths, fonts, and output compatibility before rendering.
  - Do not synthesize unsupported features; surface them as validation issues.

  CONTEXT
  - Source mode: natural_language
  - Original input snapshot: Vertical 1080x1920 trailer title card. Text VCR in Geist Pixel only. White text only on transparent alpha background. 24fps. 6 seconds. Character-by-character reveal then hard hold. No color no gradients no textures.
  - Normalization produced 1 unresolved issue(s).

  OUTPUT FORMAT
  - Primary artifact path: ./renders/out.mov
  - Emit run metadata with resolution, fps, duration_seconds, frames, codec, alpha, seed, and frame conversion policy.

unknowns_and_fixes:
- issue: Text/ASCII is requested but no explicit font is provided.
  why_it_matters: Font differences change metrics and layout, reducing output predictability.
  proposed_fix: |-
    Add:
    ascii:
      font: "GeistPixel-Line"
assumptions_applied:
- Defaulted output fps to render fps because `output.fps` was missing.
- Computed frames as round(duration_seconds*fps) (6.000*24).
- Defaulted output type to `video` because it was missing.
- Defaulted output path to `./renders/out.mov` because `output.path` was missing.
- Defaulted codec to ProRes 4444 because codec was missing and alpha is enabled.
- Defaulted deterministic seed to 0 because it was missing.
acceptance_checks:
- Spec serializes to valid YAML with expected top-level keys.
- assert render.resolution.width == 1080 && render.resolution.height == 1920
- assert render.fps == 24
- assert output.fps == 24
- assert determinism.seed == 0
- assert output.path == "./renders/out.mov" && output.codec == "prores_4444"
- assert frames == round(duration_seconds * fps) (144 == round(6.000 * 24))
- assert all referenced asset and font paths exist before render execution.
