  ROLE
  You are the VCR render engine. Execute deterministically from explicit parameters and fail fast on invalid or missing critical inputs.

  TASK
  Render with these explicit parameters:
  - Resolution: 1080x1920
  - Render FPS: 60
  - Output FPS: 60
  - Duration: 10.000s
  - Frames: 600
  - Output Type: video
  - Output Path: renders/occult_eye_pyramid.mov
  - Container: mov
  - Codec: prores_4444
  - Alpha: true
  - Determinism Seed: 0
  - No blocking validation errors were found in timing fields.

  INSTRUCTIONS
  - Determinism is required. Use the fixed seed and avoid time-varying randomness.
  - If exactly one of duration or frame count is provided, derive the other using fps and integer rounding for frames.
  - If render fps differs from output fps, apply frame sampling with interpolation disabled unless explicitly overridden.
  - Validate asset paths, fonts, and output compatibility before rendering.
  - Do not synthesize unsupported features; surface them as validation issues.

  CONTEXT
  - Source mode: natural_language
  - Original input snapshot: Objective: Create a high-fidelity 3D occult element: a floating eye above a pyramid, optimized for mobile (9:16).  1. Geometry & Aesthetic: - Build a clean 3D pyramid (sharp silhouette, stable edges) with subtle carved surface detail. - Place a floating eye directly above the pyramid apex (clearly separated, centered, and readable at all times). - Eye construction should include sclera, iris, and pupil depth (not a flat decal), with smooth geometry and no flicker. - Use high geometry density for any procedural chains/segments (minimum 120 where applicable) to prevent blobbing or temporal breakdown. - Style direction: mystical/occult, premium, cinematic, not cartoon.  2. Materials & Lighting: - Pyramid material: dark stone/obsidian with metallic edge response. - Eye material: glossy organic surface with reflective highlights and subtle emissive iris glow. - Dual-light setup:   - Primary key: warm gold/amber.   - Rim/fill: cool teal/cyan. - Keep specular highlights smooth and stable across rotation.  3. Framing & Camera (9:16 Vertical): - Composition must be perfectly centered in 1080x1920. - Maintain visual hierarchy: eye above apex with a clean negative-space gap. - Reposition camera (ro.z) and adjust focal length so the full animated element keeps at least a 15% safety margin from all edges at maximum extent. - Zero clipping is mandatory.  4. Motion: - Duration: 10 seconds. - Rotation: slow, elegant, continuous 3D motion (no jitter). - Optional subtle eye behavior: gentle iris drift/pulse, but keep deterministic and smooth.  5. Technical Spec: - Render at 60 fps. - Export as ProRes 4444 .mov with transparent background. - Output path: renders/occult_eye_pyramid.mov - Deterministic seed: 0.  6. Mandatory Verification (Truth Loop): - Generate a 1-second preview snapshot of frame 0 using ffmpeg. - Generate a 3x3 contact sheet using scripts/vcr_contact_sheet.py for the full 10-second render. - Inspect for clipping, instability, or blobbing; self-correct and rerender until clean. - Attach the final contact sheet as proof.
  - Normalization produced 1 unresolved issue(s).

  OUTPUT FORMAT
  - Primary artifact path: renders/occult_eye_pyramid.mov
  - Emit run metadata with resolution, fps, duration_seconds, frames, codec, alpha, seed, and frame conversion policy.

      Objective: Create a high-fidelity 3D occult element: a floating eye above a pyramid, optimized for mobile (9:16).

      1. Geometry & Aesthetic:
      - Build a clean 3D pyramid (sharp silhouette, stable edges) with subtle carved surface detail.
      - Place a floating eye directly above the pyramid apex (clearly separated, centered, and readable at all times).
      - Eye construction should include sclera, iris, and pupil depth (not a flat decal), with smooth geometry and no flicker.
      - Use high geometry density for any procedural chains/segments (minimum 120 where applicable) to prevent blobbing or temporal breakdown.
      - Style direction: mystical/occult, premium, cinematic, not cartoon.

      2. Materials & Lighting:
      - Pyramid material: dark stone/obsidian with metallic edge response.
      - Eye material: glossy organic surface with reflective highlights and subtle emissive iris glow.
      - Dual-light setup:

      - Composition must be perfectly centered in 1080x1920.

unknowns_and_fixes:
- issue: 'Ambiguous style terms without deterministic parameter mapping: cinematic.'
  why_it_matters: Casual style words are subjective and can produce inconsistent outputs.
  proposed_fix: |-
    Add explicit style directives in YAML, for example:
    scene:
      style_directives:
        bloom: 0.2
        chromatic_aberration_px: 1.5
        grain_strength: 0.1
assumptions_applied:
- Defaulted output fps to render fps because `output.fps` was missing.
- Computed frames as round(duration_seconds*fps) (10.000*60).
acceptance_checks:
- Spec serializes to valid YAML with expected top-level keys.
- assert render.resolution.width == 1080 && render.resolution.height == 1920
- assert render.fps == 60
- assert output.fps == 60
- assert determinism.seed == 0
- assert output.path == "renders/occult_eye_pyramid.mov" && output.codec == "prores_4444"
- assert frames == round(duration_seconds * fps) (600 == round(10.000 * 60))
- assert all referenced asset and font paths exist before render execution.
