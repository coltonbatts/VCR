  ROLE
  You are the VCR render engine. Execute deterministically from explicit parameters and fail fast on invalid or missing critical inputs.

  TASK
  Render with these explicit parameters:
  - Resolution: 1080x1920
  - Render FPS: 60
  - Output FPS: 60
  - Duration: 10.000s
  - Frames: 600
  - Output Type: video
  - Output Path: ./renders/template.mov
  - Container: mov
  - Codec: prores_4444
  - Alpha: true
  - Determinism Seed: 0
  - No blocking validation errors were found in timing fields.

  INSTRUCTIONS
  - Determinism is required. Use the fixed seed and avoid time-varying randomness.
  - If exactly one of duration or frame count is provided, derive the other using fps and integer rounding for frames.
  - If render fps differs from output fps, apply frame sampling with interpolation disabled unless explicitly overridden.
  - Validate asset paths, fonts, and output compatibility before rendering.
  - Do not synthesize unsupported features; surface them as validation issues.

  CONTEXT

  - Normalization produced 0 unresolved issue(s).

  OUTPUT FORMAT
  - Primary artifact path: ./renders/template.mov
  - Emit run metadata with resolution, fps, duration_seconds, frames, codec, alpha, seed, and frame conversion policy.

unknowns_and_fixes: []
assumptions_applied:
- Defaulted output fps to render fps because `output.fps` was missing.
- Computed frames as round(duration_seconds*fps) (10.000*60).
acceptance_checks:
- Spec serializes to valid YAML with expected top-level keys.
- assert render.resolution.width == 1080 && render.resolution.height == 1920
- assert render.fps == 60
- assert output.fps == 60
- assert determinism.seed == 0
- assert output.path == "./renders/template.mov" && output.codec == "prores_4444"
- assert frames == round(duration_seconds * fps) (600 == round(10.000 * 60))
- assert all referenced asset and font paths exist before render execution.
